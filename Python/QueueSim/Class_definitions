Initial class definitions for Object Oriented simulation model:

Job: passive object, attributes describe characteristics and states
Task: modelled as tasks of parallel jobs, created and initialized by the cluster object

Arrival: generates synthetic jobs of various types until end of sim

Resources (Node): compute resources. Think about how to differentiate between fat and normal nodes

Global scheduler: Needed? Review SLURM accounting
    Job Queue
    Task Queue

Cluster: ???

SIMPY Notes:

PROCESSES
Active objects: process objects, must inherit from Process class. E.g. message in computer network
At least 1 Process Execution Method (PEM) must be defined in each Process class

A Process Execution Method (PEM) defines the actions that are performed by its process objects.
Each PEM must contain at least one of the yield statements, described later.
This makes it a Python generator function so that it has resumable execution â€“
it can be restarted again after the yield statement without losing its current state.
A PEM may have any name of your choice. For example it may be called execute( ) or run( ).
